  <div>
    <p>OneMonthCampus is an open learning and coworking environment. You can chose to learn or get better at any creative skill or simply work at things you have already been working on.</p>

    <p>In order to make sure, that everyone has a productive time, we will have a goal setting exercise at the start of month and a progress check every week and a standup every weekday.</p>

    <p>It's not a bootcamp and is not meant to be intense. Learners will mostly be using internet resources but with peers in a physical setting. We would love to have mentors on as many skills as possible, however we can't guarantee it, hopefully the crowd will be diverse enough to have some senior people from various skillsets. So if you are experienced in any field and would like to mentor young people, do come. The conducting team is proficient in software development so people interested in learning programming will definitely have mentors. Nonetheless, expect a very supportive community.</p>

    <p>Participants are highly encouraged to participate in all community events actively.</p>

    <p>OneMonthCampus is being organised in Ghoomakad. Participants will share rooms which generally have two beds. If you are a couple, you can request for a private room too (subject to availability). The rooms are traditional mud-houses and make for a very comfortable stay.</p>

    <p>There is a dedicated co-working space with ergonomic chairs and tables and has a very reliable internet connection.</p>

    <p>Ghoomakad has a dedicated kitchen staff and will prepare breakfast, lunch and dinner for all the participants.</p>
