    <p>OneMonthCampus is an open learning and coworking environment. You can chose to learn or get better at any creative skill or simply work at things you have already been working on.</p>

    <p>Why?</p>

    <p>Internet has plenty of free learning resources(MOOCs and other tutorials). However, the percentage of people who actually finish a course is less than 10%. Lack of offline peers, social interaction around the course, live help and readily available mentors are part of the problem. OneMonthCampus is a pilot to address this issue and create an environment where learners can stay engaged and motivated.</p>

    <p>Structure</p>

    <p>In order to make sure, that everyone has a productive time, we will have a goal setting exercise at the start of month and a progress check every week and a standup every weekday. Learners are expected to show a learning artifact at the end of the month.</p>


    <p>Currently, We have in-campus mentors available for following courses.</p>

    <p>Web Development</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Web development basics (HTML, CSS, JS)</li>
        <li>Front-end framework (ReactJS)</li>
        <li>Back-end framework (NodeJS)</li>
        <li>Ruby, Ruby on Rails</li>
      </ul>

    <p>Machine Learning & AI</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ML & AI using python</li>
      </ul>

    

    <p>We are trying to find mentors for as many skills as possible. If you have experience in any field and would volunteer to mentor young people, please let us know.</p>

    <p>If you want to learn a skill that we don't currently have mentors on, we would still love to have you here and will find ways to support you.</p>

    <p>Participants are highly encouraged to participate in all community events actively.</p>

    <p>There is a dedicated co-working space with ergonomic chairs and tables and has a very reliable internet connection.</p>

    <p>Ghoomakad has a dedicated kitchen staff and will prepare breakfast, lunch and dinner for all the participants.</p>
